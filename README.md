This repository is related to the O'Reilly Course by Mohit Batra: Azure Cosmos DB Developer Specialty (DP-420) Certification Course

#### About the Course
Applications these days need to work with large volumes of data – be it in eCommerce, social media, fraud detection or personalization. For this ever-growing data, organizations need robust, highly scalable, extremely fast, and low-cost data stores. Azure Cosmos DB provides just that.

Cosmos DB is a NoSQL platform available on Azure cloud that can handle mission-critical workloads. It can store vast amounts of semi-structured data that can cater to various use cases, and can help build truly global applications.

In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of Azure Cosmos DB and then dive deeper into it. First, you’ll learn what Cosmos DB is and why it is required. Then you’ll learn how to build a data model. Next, you’ll see how to handle the data, build applications, and run queries on it. Followed by this, how Cosmos DB can be integrated as part of a solution with services like Azure functions, Azure Data Factory, Azure Synapse, etc. You’ll also learn how to optimize Cosmos DB solutions. And finally, you’ll see how secure, deploy, and monitor Cosmos DB solutions.

This course will you prepare for Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB Developer Specialty certification (Exam DP-420: Designing and Implementing Cloud-Native Applications Using Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB).
